Various ML algorithms for implementation and understanding.

- multiclass_logistic_regression

The problem statement given has 3 classes of flowers. The approach was meant to
be Logistic Regression, which is a binary classification method. To overcome the
barrier of 2 classes and to classify more than 2 classes there are a few ways to do this.
One such way is to compile N number of classifiers by dividing them into binary subjects.
Then at the end predict by finding the maximum value gained after the prediction
and classify it accordingly. This methodology is known as One vs All to tackle Logistic Regression.
Therefore I have used the OnevsAll methodology.
Comments are added to aid in understanding of the code.
(Do not forget to add dataset file iris.csv).

- bacterial_image_classifier

Demo implementation via a Machine Learning Approach. Use of pre-processing, feature extraction and DNN techniques to classify bacterial images.

- classifier_visualization

naive bayes classifier and decision tree along with visualization (F1-score, accuracy, precision, confusion matrix)
